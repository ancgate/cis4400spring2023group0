# Term Project or Homework for Professor Jefferson Bien-Aime Data Warehouse for Analytics

This is a cool project Natalia, Taseen and Jefferson is working on. This will be next revolution in quantum mechanics. 3 years from this commit, you will be able to travel back in time. If this is not possible, then we will go to another universe, proving the existence of the multiverse.

## Data Source 

[PPP Loan Data](https://data.sba.gov/dataset/ppp-foia).

This is the data source for our project. You will see that in 3 years from now. This data will disappear without any intervention from us. That's the beauty of the concept of entanglement in Quantum Mechanics.
